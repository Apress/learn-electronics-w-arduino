/*
  Keypad
 
 Turns on and off a vibration motor connected to digital  
 pin 13, when pressing a 3 specified buttons (1,2,3) on a keypad attached to pin 2. 
 
 
 The circuit:
 * transistor driver base resistor attached from pin 13 and emitter to ground 
 * keypad pushbutton common "K" attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * keypad pins D, E, F attached to 3 -10 resistors wired to 2
 * 3-10K resistors attached to pin 2 from ground
 
 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:

  // if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
